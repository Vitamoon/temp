Calling: mdrun -c frame40.gro -s frame40.tpr -x frame40.xtc -cpt 15 -nt 11 -ntmpi 1

Compiled SIMD: AVX2_256, but for this host/run AVX_512 might be better (see
log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
GROMACS was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding GROMACS with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
Reading file frame40.tpr, VERSION 2020.2 (single precision)

This run will default to '-update gpu' as requested by the GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU environment variable. GPU update with domain decomposition lacks substantial testing and should be used with caution.
Can not increase nstlist because verlet-buffer-tolerance is not set or used

Update task on the GPU was required, by the GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU environment variable, but the following condition(s) were not satisfied:

Either PME or short-ranged non-bonded interaction tasks must run on the GPU.
Compatible GPUs must have been found.
Only a CUDA build is supported.
Virtual sites are not supported.
Non-connecting constraints are not supported
The number of coupled constraints is higher than supported in the CUDA LINCS code.

Will use CPU version of update.
